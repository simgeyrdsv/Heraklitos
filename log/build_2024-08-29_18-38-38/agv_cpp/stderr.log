[31mCMake Error at CMakeLists.txt:12 (find_package):
  By not providing "Findagv_interface.cmake" in CMAKE_MODULE_PATH this
  project has asked CMake to find a package configuration file provided by
  "agv_interface", but CMake did not find one.

  Could not find a package configuration file provided by "agv_interface"
  with any of the following names:

    agv_interfaceConfig.cmake
    agv_interface-config.cmake

  Add the installation prefix of "agv_interface" to CMAKE_PREFIX_PATH or set
  "agv_interface_DIR" to a directory containing one of the above files.  If
  "agv_interface" provides a separate development package or SDK, be sure it
  has been installed.
